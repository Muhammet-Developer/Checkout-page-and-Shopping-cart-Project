I made the shopping cart part. I have registered some data locally and the data entered by the user has been recorded locally in his browser.
In the 1.Spette, a notification is given before the product is below 1, I confirmed whether you want to delete this product. If they approve, they will be deleted, if not, they will not be deleted.
2. If he asks and approves the same question when he wants to remove the product, it will be deleted, if not, it will not be deleted.
3. If the total product in the basket exceeds $300, the shipping is set to be free.
